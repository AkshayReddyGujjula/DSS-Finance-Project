Quick brief on the project we're doing:

**What it is:**
We're analysing 5 years of US Congressional stock trades (2021-2026) to figure out if members of Congress actually beat the market or if it's just luck/insider advantage.

**The core question:**
Do Congressional portfolios outperform the S&P 500? And if they do, is it because of actual stock-picking skill, sector timing luck (overweighting tech during the boom), or access to non-public info?

**Why it matters:**
86% of Americans support banning Congressional stock trading. Trust in Congress is at 22%. Our analysis provides actual data for the policy debate around trading restrictions vs transparency reforms.

**What we're doing:**
- Scraping trades from Capitol Trades + fetching stock prices
- Testing 7 hypotheses (outperformance, party differences, committee effects, trade size, etc.)
- Building a predictive model to identify what predicts trade success
- EDA + stats testing + machine learning

**Deliverables:**
- Clean dataset + summary stats (Week 2)
- 8-12 visualisations + findings (Week 3)
- Predictive model (Week 4)
- Final presentation (8-10 slides) + GitHub repo + technical report (Week 5)
